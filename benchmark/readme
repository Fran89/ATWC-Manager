The benchmark.atwc file is a manually contructed ATWC file which is
 an internal NTWC seismic data format.  The format looks like:

structure DISKHEADER (24 bytes)
structure CHNLHEADER (208 bytes (200 bytes in the example) * the NumStations defined in the DISKHEADER)
chn 0 samp0, chn 0 samp1, ... chn 0 lNumSamps-1
chn 1 samp0, chn 1 samp1, ... chn 1 lNumSamps-1
                .
                .
                .
chn NSta-1 samp0, chn NSta-1 samp1, ... chn NSta-1 lNumSamps-1

Samp0 from each channel is the same time (well, almost), etc.
The data is written in binary (always i4).
Filename contain information about the time it was written. The file name is in the form

[RootDirectory]\Dyymmdd\Hmdhhmm.[Suffix]yy.  

Each day gets a new sub-directory. 

benchmark.atwc is composed of 2 Headers (HNE, HNN) and 1 Station (MY10) and contains
60 sec of data at 40sps (total 2400 samps).

HNE contains:           HNN contains:
 1 for 15s               0 for 15s
 0 for 15s               1 for 15s
-1 for 15s               0 for 15s
 0 for 15s              -1 for 15s
 1 for 15s               0 for 15s
 
It should output a minute starting from Jun 10, 2017.
